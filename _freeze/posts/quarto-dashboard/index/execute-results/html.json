The following dashboard was built using quarto, with simple interactivity built using `gt`, and `plotly`.\n\nThe most powerful feature of quarto dashboards is the ability to create complex dashboards very quicly and easily within quarto. The interactivity is provided by `gt` and `plotly` so no `shiny` server is needed. The dashboard is also fully self contained and standalone, so the dashboard can be easily shared via email as a standalone html file or shared online using a static web hosting such as github pages.\n\nThe github for the raw code used to build the following dashboard can be found here: [https://github.com/mluu921/quarto-dashboard-practice](https://github.com/mluu921/quarto-dashboard-practice)\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen-inset}\n<iframe src=\"https://michaelluu.info/quarto-dashboard-practice/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n",
