The following blog post is a demonstration of the new dashboard feature released in quarto 1.4. The following dashboard was built using quarto, with simple interactivity built using `gt`, and `plotly`.

The most powerful feature of quarto dashboards is the ability to create complex dashboards very quicly and easily within quarto. The interactivity is provided by `gt` and `plotly` so no `shiny` server is needed. The dashboard is also fully self contained and standalone, so the dashboard can be easily shared via email as a standalone html file or shared online using a static web hosting such as github pages.

The github for the raw code used to build the following dashboard can be found here: [https://github.com/mluu921/quarto-dashboard-practice](https://github.com/mluu921/quarto-dashboard-practice)
